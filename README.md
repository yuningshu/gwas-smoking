This study investigates the genetic basis of smoking initiation by analyzing summary statistics from a large genome-wide association study (GWAS) dataset (ieu-b-4877) by Liu et al. (2019). We aim to identify independent loci significantly associated with the likelihood of initiating smoking and annotate them to uncover potential biological mechanisms. We conduct functional mapping using Ensembl and perform linkage disequilibrium (LD) clumping to filter top-associated variants.

Our findings reveal multiple genome-wide significant loci, including previously implicated genes such as CHRNA5 and BDNF, as well as potentially novel variants. These results reveal the relevance of potential signaling pathways in smoking behaviors and offer candidate targets for future behavioral or pharmacological interventions.
